      <p>
        Build modern web applications with just the features you need.

      <p>
        Pulsor aims to be a more productive simplification of React + Redux by implementing the state management directly in the VDOM event system. 
        This approach allows us to design a much more declarative, simpler and symetrical API for managing application state.

          The project is still in an experimental phase, with it's main goal being to design the best “API” for building any frontend app.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe that any UI can be defined as a single, strongly typed, nested datastructure. 
          We want to take the time to explore as many different ways to do define UI behavior, and iteratively land on the most elegant solution.
