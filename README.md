# pulsor
> The next ~~evolution~~ simplification in declarative, state-driven UIs.

[under heavy development]

- unreleased
- unstable

Pulsor is an all-in-one DOM rendering and state management solution in a tiny ~3kb "self rendering" virtual dom. It aims to be a more productive simplification of React + Redux by implementing the state management directly in the VDOM event system. This approach allows us to design a much more declarative, simpler and symetrical API for managing application state.
